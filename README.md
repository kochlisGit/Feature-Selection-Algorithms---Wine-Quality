# Wine Preference Analysis

The purpose of this work is the modeling of the wine preferences by physicochemical properties.
Wine quality is a key element within this context. Certification prevents the illegal adulteration of wines
and assures quality for the wine market. Quality evaluation is often part of the certification process 
and can be used to improve wine making and to stratify wines such as premium brands (useful for setting prices).
Such model is useful to support the oenologist wine tasting evaluations, improve and speed-up the wine production.

-------------------------

The dataset that was used in this work includes white and red wine samples, which are described by
12 columns.  According to the oenology theory, a wine can be described by:
1. Type (*Red, White, Ros√©, Sparkling and Fortified (Dessert)*): The different types of wine.
2. Fixed Acidity (*1000 mg/L - 4000 mg/L*): Organic acids of wines whose volatilities are so low that cannot be separated from wine by distillation
3. Citric Acid (*< 500 mg/L*): Citric acid is used as supplement during the fermentation process to boost the acidity of wine
4. Residual Sugar (*> 35 mg/L*): Natural grape sugars leftover in a wine after the alcoholic fermentation
5. Chlorides (*< 606 mg/L*): A major contributor to saltiness in wine
6. Free sulfur Dioxide (*< 350 mg/L*): A wine additive that preserves wine's freshness and fruit characters by virtue of antioxidant, antimicrobial and anti-enzymatic properties
7. Total Sulfur Dioxide (*< 350 mg/L*): The portion of $SO_{2}$ that is free in the wine plus the portion that is bound to other chemicals such as aldehydes, pigments, or sugars
8. Density (*1080 - 1090 mg/*$cm^3$): The density of the wine
9. pH (*2.5 pH - 4.5 pH*): A scale used to specify the acidity of the wine
10. Sulphites (*5 mg/l - 2000 mg/L*): chemical by-products created during the fermentation process, also used in food preservation
11. Alcohol (*5.5% - 25%*): The total concentration of alchohol
